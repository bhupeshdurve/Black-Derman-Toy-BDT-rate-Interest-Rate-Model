# Black-Derman-Toy-BDT-rate-Interest-Rate-Model

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Black-Derman-Toy (BDT) interest rate model. The BDT model is a popular one-factor short-rate model used in finance for interest rate modeling, particularly for modeling bond prices and yields.

Overview
The BDT model assumes that the short-term interest rate follows a log-normal distribution. The primary goal of this implementation is to construct a short-rate tree based on observed yields and volatilities. The model parameters are estimated using Newton's method, and the short-rate tree is constructed accordingly.

Run the Python script containing the BDT model implementation.

Input the observed yields and volatilities.

The script will calibrate the model parameters and construct the short-rate tree.
